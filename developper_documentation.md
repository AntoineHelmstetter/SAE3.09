# Developper Documentation for Client - Server Application

## _This Documentation is a part of the requirement for the SAE309 which explains how to use the application in all ways possible and how to modify it if you want to._

### This application is conformed with the rules explained in the easy difficulty in the rules of the project, written by Mr. Drouhin.

This application has also been made with Python and contains a few commentaries that gives you explanations about how the application has been made.

First of all, if you want to add a new command, you will have to create a new if loop in the code of the application.

If you want to, go to the line 131 on the serveur.py file, before the else closing of the function. 

You have all the rights to modify it as you want to.

Dev opinion : 
It would be great to add a graphical interface to make easier the usage of the application.
Due to family and personnal problems, I didn't have the time to do it properly so I put all myself on the principal usage of the application, a discussion between a server and a client.
Finally, as a novice in the python language, It would be easier for me to make it in C or C++, but the rules are the rules.
